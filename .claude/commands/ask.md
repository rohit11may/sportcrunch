## Agents Reference

When user asks to "audit", "review", "scan", or "check" code, launch the appropriate agent:




## Routing Instructions

1. **Match user's question** to the skills and agents listed above
2. **Invoke matching skill** using the Skill tool
3. **For code review requests** (audit, review, scan, check), launch the appropriate agent
4. **If no clear match**, use the `getting-started` skill to help find the right resource
