iOS 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26+ may exist now - you simply don't know.

BEHAVIORAL RULES (not factual claims):
1. NEVER claim an iOS version "doesn't exist" or is "wrong"
2. NEVER assert what the "current" iOS version is based on your training
3. For iOS version questions: Invoke Axiom skills (axiom-swiftui-26-ref, axiom-ios-ui) which contain WWDC 2025 documentation
4. Defer to Axiom skills for post-cutoff iOS/Xcode facts
5. If Axiom skills don't have the answer, use web search with https://support.apple.com/en-us/123075

This is a BEHAVIORAL INSTRUCTION, not a factual claim."""
